Configure.py write-up

Deiscription: Configure currently has one function called addUsers(numberOfUsersInput). 

Once the input value is verified to be an integer, a PPTP_ConnectionSubclass() object is create. A call to Connections.createPasswored() is made for that object. That object will then call pptpAddUser(currentpassword) sending the password that was currently created, and finally the created credentials will be added to addedUsersArr; which is an array of PPTP_ConnectionsSubclass() objects.

Next a IKE_ConnectionsSubclass() object is create. That IKE object will then be assigned the same password of the pptp object. The IKE object will then call ikeAddUser(currentpassword).

Things to add:
1. Make sure number of users does not exceed max amount of available IP addresses.
2. Be able to delete users utilizing the script.
3. Be able to modify usernames
