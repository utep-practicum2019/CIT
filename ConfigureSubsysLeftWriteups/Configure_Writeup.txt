Configure.py write-up

Deiscription: Configure currently has one function called addUsers(). When called, the user will be prompted for an integer amount of users to add. Once the input value is verified to be an integer, ChappieEditor.py and IkesEditor.py are called to add users to cahpsecrets and ipsec.secrets.

Test Cases: 
It was tested using a text file that was formatted similar to the chap secret file and ipsec.secrets. In that all non-user lines were commented out with #. 
1. Attempt to input anything other than an integer.
2. Add some comments and see if they are skipped over when the file is read (e.g. #Test)
3. Attempt to add users when no user information is in the file.
4. Add some users to the file, and then attempt to add the proceeding user(e.g. user1 * 96550403 192.168.0.2 initially in file then when adding one more user, user2 * 24646635 192.168.0.3 should be written to the file next). 

Things to add:
1. Make sure number of users does not exceed max amount of available IP addresses.
2. Be able to delete users utilizing the script.
3. Be able so synchronize lists if necessary.
