Connections.py write-up

Deiscription: Connections.py is a superclass that has the basic function definition for adding users, and it also has the default object variables for user information.
It has two implemented methods: createPassword and checkCurUsers.
createPassword creates a single password for both PPTP and IKEv2.
checCurUsers is called from the varying VPN subclasses to check the next available user. 

Things to add:
1. Make sure number of users does not exceed max amount of available IP addresses.
2. Be able to delete users utilizing the script.
3. Be able to modify usernames
