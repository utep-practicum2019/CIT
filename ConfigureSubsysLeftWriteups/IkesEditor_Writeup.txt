IkesEditor.py write-up

Deiscription: IkesEditor adds users to the list in the ipsec.secret file. The file is read by calling CheckUsers() in the superclass Connections, and the script then adds the next user in numerical order (e.g. Adding user2 after user1). The password is an seven to eight digit randomly generated password.

Things to add:
1. Make sure number of users does not exceed max amount of available IP addresses.
2. Be able to delete users utilizing the script.
3. Be able to modify usernames
