Connections.py write-up

Deiscription: Connections.py is a superclass that has the basic function definition for adding users, and it also has the default object variables for user information.

It has four implemented functions: 

createPassword()-Creates a single 8 digit, randomly generated, password for both PPTP and IKEv2

checkCurUsers(secretsFile)-checCurUsers is called from the varying VPN subclasses to check the next available user and IP

deleteUser(currUser,fileName)-This function opens a temp file where all users minus the user to be delted is written to. Once this is completed the temp file contents are written back to the correct secrets files.

modifyUser(self, currUsername,newUsername,newPassword,newIP)-Calls deleteUser for the current username, then writes directly to both secrets files with the current user information.
